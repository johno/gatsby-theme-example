# Gatsby Theme Example

This illustrates a basic theme and starter workflow.

```sh
yarn
yarn workspace gatsby-starter-theme-example develop
```

### Starter repo publishing

This project uses a GitHub Action to publish starters to their own
repositories so that it works seamlessly with `gatsby new`.
